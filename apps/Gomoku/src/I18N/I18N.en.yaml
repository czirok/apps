  This Gomoku game is based on the winning engine from Microsoft's 2003 programming competition.

  The original C++ Pela engine was created by Petr Laštovička and later converted to C# during the Microsoft competition. The goal of the competition was to create the best Gomoku engine, where the winner received 100,000 Czech crowns.

  This modern GTK4/Libadwaita implementation maintains the original game logic but with a contemporary user interface for Linux systems.
